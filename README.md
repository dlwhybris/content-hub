  Gatsby-Tailwind-Blog-Starter
</h1>
A Blog starter for Gatsby powered by Tailwind. Netlify CMS support is foreseen as well

## ðŸš€ Quick start


1.  **Installation**

    ```sh
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Tailwind

For full documentation, visit [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- **For testing purposes without any installation, you can start with [Tailwind Run](https://tailwind.run/new).** It's a browser based editor loading Tailwind by default so you can play around


## ðŸ“” Learning Netlify CMS with Gatsby

Start from [this point](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-netlify-cms/#authenticating-with-github) in the Gatsby documentation to finish the set up for your personal Netlify CMS with authentication.
